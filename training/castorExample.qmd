[Castor](https://github.com/bcgov/castor) is a forest and land-use model
used to simulate forest harvest and its effects on multiple forest
values, which include not only timber, but also habitat for several
wildlife (e.g. caribou, fisher). It is a fully open-source model,
implemented in `SpaDES`, developed and maintained by researchers at the
Forest Analysis and Inventory Branch, BC Ministry of Forests.

In this chapter, we demonstrate how to set up a Castor workflow using
`setupProject` from the
[`SpaDES.project`](https://spades-project.predictiveecology.org/)
package. The code was adapted from [this Castor
scenario](https://github.com/bcgov/castor/blob/main/R/scenarios/comparison_stsm/base_case_harvest_flow_20230628.Rmd),
with some modifications to streamline the code and accommodate the use
of `SpaDES.project` functions.

A bare-bones version of this example is also available in this [.R
script](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/PredictiveEcology.org/blob/training-book/tutos/castorExample/castorExample.R)

## Workflow setup {#sec-castorSetup}

`SpaDES.project` functions expect SpaDES modules to either exist
locally, or at root level of separate repositories. This is not the case
with Castor modules, which are in a nested folder (i.e. a folder in a
folder tree) of a single GitHub repository.

`SpaDES.project` will eventually be able to deal with this[^1], but for
now we work around this issue by using a custom function called
`getCastorModulesAndDB`. This function will also download the demo
SQLite database from Google Drive[^2]. You'll be prompted to authorise
this operation and a browser window will open for this. Make sure you
give `tidyverse` read/write access to your files:

```{r fig-gdriveauth}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-width: 5

figPath <- normalizePath(file.path(qmdPath, "assets/img/gdriveauth.png"),
                winslash = "/")

knitr::include_graphics(figPath, rel_path = FALSE, dpi = NA)
```

After the "workaround" `setupProject` does all the heavy-lifting of
setting up the workflow, namely installing all package dependencies
listed in the several modules and in `setupProject(..., packages)`,
creating all the necessary folders, sourcing additional files and
creating parameter, inputs and outputs lists -- see
[`?setupProject`](https://spades-project.predictiveecology.org/reference/setupProject.html).

    ))

```

## Initialise the model and inspect `simList`

`setupProject()` returns a names list containing values that can be
passed as argument to
[`simInit()`](https://rdrr.io/cran/SpaDES.core/man/simInit.html)[^3].

We use `do.call()` to pass the whole list of arguments to `simInit`.

```{r simInit}
#| results: hide

## initialize simulation
castorInit <- do.call(SpaDES.core::simInit, out)
```

Another (more verbose) option would to call `simInit` directly:

```{r simInit2}
#| eval: false

castorInit <- SpaDES.core::simInit(
  times = out$times,
  params = out$params, 
  modules = out$modules, 
  objects = list(scenario = out$scenario, 
                 harvestFlow = out$harvestFlow)
)
```

Use the following functions to access workflow/model properties.
`events()`, for instance will output the scheduled events, which at this
point are only the `init` events of each module as you can see in the
output below.

```{r inspectSimList}
#| eval: false

## inspect the `simList`
SpaDES.core::params(castorInit) 
SpaDES.core::inputs(castorInit)
SpaDES.core::outputs(castorInit)
SpaDES.core::times(castorInit) 

## scheduled events
SpaDES.core::events(castorInit) 
```

```{r events}
#| echo: false

SpaDES.core::events(castorInit) 
```

## Visualize the workflow

`moduleDiagram()` and `objectDiagram()` are great to visualise how each
module interacts with the other. Recall that these interactions arise
from object "exchanges" between modules, which are deduced by
`simInit()` from module metadata (@fig-objectDiagram) -- i.e., if a
module's inputs are another's outputs, then the first module will follow
the second.

```{r diagrams}
#| eval: false

SpaDES.core::moduleDiagram(castorInit)
SpaDES.core::objectDiagram(castorInit)
```

```{r fig-moduleDiagram}
#| echo: false
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-cap: "Diagram of module connections."

SpaDES.core::moduleDiagram(castorInit)
```

```{r fig-objectDiagram}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-cap: "Diagram of module inter-dependencies with object names."
#| fig-width: 10

figPath <- normalizePath(file.path(qmdPath, "assets/img/castorExample_objDiagram.png"),
                winslash = "/")

knitr::include_graphics(figPath, rel_path = FALSE, dpi = NA)
```

## Run simulation

`spades()` runs the simulation, beginning with the execution of the
`init` events. Notice how the result of `outputs()` differs from
previously.

```{r runsim}
#| eval: false

castorSim <- SpaDES.core::spades(castorInit)

## we now have outputs
SpaDES.core::outputs(castorSim)
```

```{r runsim2}
#| include: false

castorSim <- SpaDES.core::spades(castorInit)
```

```{r outputs}
#| echo: false

SpaDES.core::outputs(castorSim)
```

`completed(castorSim)` shows the chaining of events that was produced
and run by `spades()`. The sequence of steps in the workflow therefore
arises from each module's events and their scheduling, rather than being
explicitly imposed by the user.

```{r completedevents}
#| outlines: 10
SpaDES.core::completed(castorSim)
```

We suggest omitting the `blockingCastor` module in `setupProject()` and
rerunning the workflow again to see how `spades` is capable of
re-generating a new workflow with little effort from the user.

```{r newWF}
#| eval: false

             "growingStockCastor",
