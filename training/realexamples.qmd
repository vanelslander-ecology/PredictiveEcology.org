# "Real-world" examples of SpaDES workflows

This chapter will take you through several "real-world" examples that use SpaDES
to build and execute a workflow. By "real-world" we mean workflows that use 
models that have been/are used in research or application.

Because we will not explain each model or the SpaDES modules in detail, we encourage
learning more about these models from the sources noted in the chapters.
