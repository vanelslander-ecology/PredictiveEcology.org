    "title": "Research Associate Job: Forecasting land use changes due to resource development to improve boreal caribou conservation",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Northern ecosystems in Canada are changing at a rate twice as fast as other areas of the globe due to climate change. Climate change can result in direct effects on wildlife (higher mortality, lower reproduction) but also indirect effects on their habitat through changes in vegetation (e.g. shifts in tree species composition within forests) and natural disturbances like wildfire (e.g. increase in the frequency and size of fires). In addition to climate change, northern ecosystems are affected by human disturbance primarily associated with resource development that includes: forestry, conventional oil and gas development and extraction, mineral mining, wind power, linear features and road development. Boreal caribou are a species of cultural, economic, and ecological importance in northern regions of Canada. Numerous sources have identified these anthropogenic disturbances as the most important contributor to declines of boreal caribou; yet, forecasting these disturbances, and their interactions with vegetation and natural disturbances under climate change remains a challenge.\nThe Department of Forest Resources Management, UBC-Vancouver campus, seeks a Research Associate to undertake research on forecasting land use changes due to resource development to improve boreal caribou conservation. This research associate will be responsible for undertaking research on a project funded by Cumulative Impact Monitoring Program of the Government of Northwest Territories (NWT CIMP) and supported by Environment and Climate Change Canada and Natural Resources Canada under the supervision of Dr. Eliot McIntire and in collaboration with researchers from ENR/GNWT, the Canadian Forest Service (CFS), ECCC, and the UBC Faculty of Forestry. The overall objective of the position is to develop and implement new models that can forecast the impacts of resource development on boreal caribou resource selection and population demographics in Northwest Territories (NT), Canada. The specific objectives are: (1) to compile resource development potential mapping within the boreal region of Northwest Territories, Canada (NT); (2) to integrate resource development potential mapping with forecasts of vegetation, wildfire, climate, and caribou developed within the boreal regions within NT; and (3) forecast through time (2021-2100) the regional cumulative effects of resource development, vegetation, wildfire, and climate on habitat supply and boreal caribou population demographics by examining resource development scenarios.\nThis project will take advantage of an open modeling framework – SpaDES, developed within the R language – to integrate the novel components created here with existing models (vegetation dynamics, wildfire, caribou resource selection and population growth). Results from this work will help inform current and future cumulative effects on boreal caribou habitat supply and population demography and support caribou range planning and decision making in the NT. The successful candidate will work with a network of landscape scientists, northern scientists, caribou biologists, R programmers, and quantitative ecologists.\n\nRequired qualifications:\n• A PhD in ecology, natural resource sciences, geography, applied mathematics, computer science, statistics, or a related field; • A minimum of 4 years postdoctoral research experience with landscape simulation, wildlife forecasting, and highly integrated projects; • Proven experience with landscape change simulation including forest growth and mortality, and wildfire simulations at large spatial scale (&gt; 1Mi km2) (i.e., publication in peer-reviewed journal); • Proven experience with forecasting of caribou demographics and habitat (i.e., resource selection models, population growth models, etc.); • Knowledge of the current anthropogenic disturbance challenges in the Northern Boreal Forests of Canada, especially in the Northwest Territories; • Proven advanced knowledge of SpaDES and development of SpaDES modules shown in at least one publication as first author in peer-reviewed literature; • High-level programming skills in R (i.e., statistical analysis, model development, GIS and package development); • Proven experience with version control for coding purposes (i.e., GitHub or similar); • Experience managing or co-managing large scale and highly integrated projects; • Good publication record (i.e., peer-reviewed journal articles, including first author publications) in the last 7 years; • Advanced knowledge in GIS applications (including ArcGIS, QGIS and use of open-source GIS packages in R); • Proven experience with climate change projections; • Excellent oral and written communication skills; • Ability to work in a dynamic and diverse large research team; • Ability to work and communicate within a distributed team (e.g., Zulip or Slack); • Ability to work on a project with defined milestones and timelines.\n\n\nPosition Details:\nThe 2-year position will begin as soon as the candidate is available, with immediate start possible. The minimum annual salary, in accordance with UBC HR guidelines, will be set at $ 60,205 plus benefits. The research associate position will be administered at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC. The position will be primarily located in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, at the Pacific Forestry Centre. There may be opportunities for visits to NT to work with collaborators and engage partners although travel with depend on current COVID-19 public health guidance. Field work is not anticipated.\nApplications should consist of cover letter, CV and contact information of three references. Please direct inquiries to Principal Investigator, Dr. Eliot McIntire by email eliot.mcintire@ubc.ca.\nApplications should be submitted via Workday: JR8063. Deadline for applications is July 21, 2022 at 11:59pm.\nAll appointments are subject to budget availability.\nAs one of the world’s leading universities, the University of British Columbia creates an exceptional learning environment that fosters global citizenship, advances a civil and sustainable society, and supports outstanding research to serve the people of British Columbia, Canada and the world.\nUBC hires on the basis of merit and is committed to employment equity.

New modules should also be created in this directory.

    "title": "Managing large SpaDES projects",
    "section": "Version control",
    "text": "Version control\n\nSimple module versioning\nEvery module has a version number in its metadata. To download a specific version of a module via downloadModule(), specify the version argument. This should be included in your project’s main script / Rmd file. Every project should be explicit about which versions of the modules it is using.\n\n\nUsing git\nMore advanced users and developers may choose to use more recent or in-development versions of the modules instead of the versions in the SpaDES-modules repository (and accessed via downloadModule()). Many SpaDES module authors/developers use GitHub for version control, so we can get tagged module versions as well as in-development versions of the code. To use version-controlled SpaDES modules in your project, we use git submodules.\nHere, we assume that you are familiar with git (and GitHub) and are also using it for version control of your own project.\nmyProject/            # a version controlled git repo\n|_  .git/\n|_  cache/            # should be .gitignore'd\n|_  inputs/           # should be .gitignore'd (selectively)\n|_  manuscripts/\n|_  modules/\n    |_  module1/      # can be a git submodule\n    |_  module2/      # can be a git submodule\n    |_  module3/      # can be a git submodule\n    |_  module4/      # can be a git submodule\n    |_  module5/      # can be a git submodule\n|_  outputs/          # should be .gitignore'd\n...\nRemember that large data files should not managed using git. Each module’s data directory should have it’s own .gitignore file. These data files should be easily retrieved via download or created by the module.\n\nUsing git submodules\nWe will add each of the SpaDES modules to our project as git submodules via the command line (but GitKraken does support git submodules). (You’ll need to delete the moduleN/ sub-directories within modules.)\ncd ~/Documents/myProject/modules\n\ngit submodule add https://github.com/USERNAMEA/module1\ngit submodule add https://github.com/USERNAMEA/module2\ngit submodule add https://github.com/USERNAMEB/module3\ngit submodule add https://github.com/USERNAMEB/module4\ngit submodule add https://github.com/USERNAMEC/module5\n\ngit push origin master\nNow our directory structure looks like this:\nmyProject/            # (https://github.com/MYUSERNAME/myProject)\n|_  .git/\n|_  cache/            # should be .gitignore'd\n|_  inputs/           # should be .gitignore'd (selectively)\n|_  manuscripts/\n|_  modules/\n    |_  module1/      # git submodule (https://github.com/USERNAMEA/module1)\n    |_  module2/      # git submodule (https://github.com/USERNAMEA/module2)\n    |_  module3/      # git submodule (https://github.com/USERNAMEB/module3)\n    |_  module4/      # git submodule (https://github.com/USERNAMEB/module4)\n    |_  module5/      # git submodule (https://github.com/USERNAMEC/module5)\n|_  outputs/          # should be .gitignore'd\n...\nIn the above example, we are working with 6 different GitHub repositories, one for each SpaDES module plus our myProject repo.\nNow, we manage each of the SpaDES modules (git submodules) independently. Because each of these submodules simply link back to another git repository, we can make changes upstream in the corresponding repo. We then need to pull in these upstream changes to specific modules as follows:\ncd ~/Documents/myProject/modules\n\ngit submodule update --remote module1\nIf we make changes to modules locally and want to push them to the remote we can do so using:\ncd ~/Documents/myProject/modules/module1\n\ngit push\nThis will push only the (committed) changes made to module1."

    "text": "Empirical data have a troublesome way of being both factually true, yet difficult to understand because they exist within a complex web of even more data. Worse, forecasting what the future will look like is an even greater challenge. Scientists have, for a long time, been working on these problems, often with great success, but the venue for reporting is generally peer reviewed journals. In 2014/15, we are now at the point that policy makers must have faster access, and in a context-appropriate way, to utilize the forecasts made by scientists. At CFS, there has been an effort to build integrated systems of communities, of data, and of models. What is still lacking is a delivery mechanism to put those forecasts into the hands of the policy makers."

    "text": "As part of a multidisciplinary study of vegetation, fire and permafrost dynamics, the successful applicant will develop spatial simulation models to forecast the abundance and spatial distribution of caribou habitat in relation to climate change, fire and human landuse in the Northwest Territories. The models are to be implemented in SpaDES, a new R package for spatial simulation and individual based modelling. Part of the thesis will involve integration of the team’s research findings, scenario development and the implementation of simulation experiments. However, the student will also be expected to conduct applied research in one related topic (e,g, vegetation dynamics, caribou movement) according to their interest, the results of which would be included as a model component. The qualifications are strong quantitative skills and an interest in spatial simulation independent of disciplinary background. A high level of written communication skills in English is essential. Programming experience (e.g. in R, Python) would be an asset, but modelling courses are available in the lab.\nWe offer a 3yr PhD scholarship at C$23,000/yr. The student will be co-supervised by Steve Cumming, Université Laval, Québec QC and Eliot McIntire, Pacific Forestry Centre, Victoria BC. By preference, the position will be tenable at Laval, with at least one semester as a visiting student at the Pacific Forestry Centre. However, we may be able to accommodate exceptional candidates who prefer to study in Western Canada. There will be opportunities to participate in the 2016 or 2017 summer field season. The position will start September 2016. Applications received before May 9th will receive full consideration.\nThe language of instruction at Université Laval is French, but theses may be written in English. Québec City is well known for its exceptional outdoor recreational opportunities, natural beauty, historical interest and vibrant cultural life. The francophone cultural environment provides non-francophone students an excellent opportunity to develop or improve French language skills\nApplicants should submit by email a short statement of interest, a sample of their scientific writing, a current CV, and the names of three references.

So, rather than say that a succession model has three modules that are dependent on one another along a sequence, like this:\n regeneration ---&gt;  growth ---------&gt; mortality\n     |               |                   |\n    \\|/             \\|/                 \\|/\n |stem counts |   |stem counts   |  |stem counts   |         \n | and size   |   |   and size   |  |   and size   |\n | by species |   |   by species |  |   by species |\n ------------     ---------------   ---------------\n; instead, we say that each takes inputs (i.e., data) and produces outputs (i.e., data) that are each definable:\nregeneration        _ growth          _ mortality\n         \\          /|     \\          /|          \\         \n         _\\|       /       _\\|       /            _\\|       \n       |stem counts |       |stem counts   |       |stem counts   |         \n       | and size   |       |   and size   |       |   and size   |\n       | by species |       |   by species |       |   by species |\n      ---------------       ----------------       ----------------\nSo, this means that we could “remove” the regeneration module, and the model will still work. We can remove the “growth” module and the model will still work. Whereas in the “interdependent” approach, it wouldn’t.\nNow the point is not to remove the growth module (what would that model do with just regen and mortality?)… but with this structure, we can replace the growth module with a different one and not break the modularity. Likewise, we can start a simulation with data of “stem counts and size by species”, rather than the output of the regen module or growth module or mortality module."

    "text": "Loops\nLoops have been the achilles heel of R in the past. In version 3.1 and forward, much of this problem appears to be gone. As could be seen in the Fibonacci example, pre-allocating a vector and filling it up inside a loop can now be very fast and efficient in native R. To demonstrate these points, below are 6 ways to achieve the same result in R, beginning with a naive loop approach, and working up to the fully vectorized approach. I am using a very fast vectorized function, seq_len, to emphasize the differences between using loops and optimized vectorized functions.\nThe basic code below generates random numbers. The sequence goes from a fully unvectorized, looped structure, with no pre-allocation of the output vector, through to pure vectorized code. The intermediate steps are:\n\nLoop\nLoop with pre-allocated length of output\nsapply (like loops)\nsapply with pipe operator\nvectorized\nvectorized with no intermediate objects\nC++ vectorized\n\nlibrary(magrittr) # for pipe %&gt;%\nlibrary(data.table)\nN = 1e5\n\nunifs &lt;- runif(N) \ndt = data.table(num=rep(NA_real_, N))\n\nmb = microbenchmark::microbenchmark(times=5L,\n\n  # no pre-allocating of vector length, generating uniform random numbers once,\n  # then calling them within each loop\n  loopWithNoPreallocate = {\n    set.seed(104)\n    a &lt;- numeric()\n      for (i in 1:N) {\n        a[i] = unifs[i]\n      } \n     a\n  },\n  \n  # pre-allocating vector length, generating uniform random numbers once,\n  # then calling them within each loop\n  loopWithPreallocate = {\n      set.seed(104)\n      a &lt;- numeric(N) \n      for (i in 1:N) {\n        a[i] = unifs[i]\n      }\n      a\n  },\n   \n  # sapply - generally faster than loops\n  sapplyVector1 = {\n        set.seed(104)\n        sapply(unifs,function(x) x)\n  },\n  \n  # sapply with pipe operator: no intermediate objects are created\n  sapplyWithPipe = {\n        set.seed(104)\n        unifs &lt;- (runif(N)) %&gt;%\n          sapply(.,function(x) x)\n  },\n  \n  # use data.table set function, which can be very fast inside a loop\n  datatableSet = {\n    set.seed(104)\n    for(i in 1L:N) {\n      set(dt, i, j = 1L, unifs[i])\n    }\n    dt\n  },\n  \n  # vectorized with intermediate object before return\n  vectorizedWithCopy = {\n      set.seed(104)\n      unifs &lt;- runif(N)\n      unifs\n  },\n  \n  # no intermediate object before return\n  vectorizedWithNoCopy = {\n    set.seed(104)\n    runif(N)\n  },\n  \n  cpp = {\n    set.seed(104)\n    runifCpp(N)\n  }\n)\n\nprint(\"Units: milliseconds\")\n## [1] \"Units: milliseconds\"\nsummary(mb, unit=\"ms\")[c(1,2,5,7,8)]\n##                    expr          min       median          max neval\n## 1 loopWithNoPreallocate 12802.511195 12908.986463 13618.461857     5\n## 2   loopWithPreallocate   141.383047   150.713476   199.640091     5\n## 3         sapplyVector1    64.211709    72.396608   104.804129     5\n## 4        sapplyWithPipe    70.540230    74.944790    82.344498     5\n## 5          datatableSet   274.122245   277.530571   286.644428     5\n## 6    vectorizedWithCopy     3.572677     3.702005     3.952369     5\n## 7  vectorizedWithNoCopy     3.729653     3.873727     4.120712     5\n## 8                   cpp     1.437057     1.578675     1.859143     5\n# Test that all results return the same vector\nall.equalV(loopWithNoPreallocate, \n           datatableSet$num, \n           loopWithPreallocate, \n           sapplyVector1, sapplyWithPipe, \n           vectorizedWithCopy, vectorizedWithNoCopy, \n           cpp[,1])\n## Warning in all(sapply(vals[-1], function(x) all.equal(vals[[1]], x))):\n## coercing argument of type 'character' to logical\n## [1] NA\nsumLoops &lt;- round(summary(mb)[[5]],1)\nThe fully vectorized function is 3489x faster than the fully naive loop. Note also that making as few intermediate objects as possible is faster as well. Comparing vectorizedWithCopy and vectorizedWithNoCopy (where the only difference is making one copy of the object) shows virtually no change. This, I believe, is due to some improvements in after version 3.1 of R that reduces copying for vectors and matrices.\nUsing pipes instead of intermediate objects also did not change the speed very much (slight change by -3.34%). Since these are simple tests, larger, or more complex objects, will likely see improvements using pipes.\nNote, in this case, the C++, using Rcpp sugar was the fastest, 2.44x faster.\nNote also, that this example is somewhat artificial, because it is also comparing the random number generating speeds at the same time as the loop speeds. Thus, these benchmarks about loops are simply for illustrative purposes. The speed gains in loops will be determined mostly by what is actually happening within the loops."

    "text": "v1.0.1 is now available on CRAN!\nBuilding spatial simulation models often involves reusing various model components, often having to re-implement similar functionality in multiple simulation frameworks (i.e, in different programming languages). When various components of a simulation model become fragmented across multiple platforms, it becomes increasingly difficult to link these various components, and often solutions for this problem are idiosyncratic and specific to the model being implemented. As a result, developing general insights into complex computational models has, in the field of ecology at least, been hampered by modellers’ typically developing models from scratch (Thiele, 2015).\nSpaDES is a generic simulation platform that can be used to create new model components quickly. It also provides a framework to link with existing simulation models, so that an already well described and mature model, e.g., Landis-II (Scheller, 2007), can be used with de novo components. Alternatively one could use several de novo models and several existing models in combination. This approach requires a platform that allows for modular reuse of model components (herein called ‘modules’) as hypotheses that can be evaluated and tested in various ways, as advocated by Thiele (2015).\nSpaDES makes it easy to implement a variety of simulation models including raster-based, event-based, and agent-based models. The core simulation components are built upon a discrete event simulation framework that facilitates modularity, and easily enables the user to include additional functionality by running user-built simulation modules. Included are numerous tools to rapidly visualize raster and other maps.\nWhen beginning development of this package, we sought a general simulation platform at least the following characteristics:\nWe selected R as the system within which to build SpaDES. R is currently the lingua franca for scientific data analysis. This means that anything developed in SpaDES is simply R code and can be easily shared with journals and the scientific community. We can likewise leverage R’s strengths as a data platform, its excellent visualization and graphics, its capabilities to run external code such as C/C++ and easily interact external software such as databases, and its abilities for high performance computing. SpaDES therefore doesn’t need to implement all of these from scratch, as they are achievable with already existing R packages."

Essentially, other procedural languages use explicit loops; programmers moving from those languages to R start with the same procedures and find that R is slow. We will discuss a range of ways making loops faster and how vectorizing can help.\nThere are many other resources about this topic; we will try to be concise and show the worst case, the best case, and many little steps in between."

    "text": "Loops\nLoops have been the achilles heel of R in the past. In version 3.1 and forward, much of this problem appears to be gone. As could be seen in the https://predictiveecology.org/2015/05/06/Is-R-fast-enough-03.html, pre-allocating a vector and filling it up inside a loop can now be very fast and efficient in native R. To demonstrate these points, below are 6 ways to achieve the same result in R, beginning with a naive loop approach, and working up to the fully vectorized approach. I am using a very fast vectorized function, seq_len, to emphasize the differences between using loops and optimized vectorized functions.\nThe basic code below generates random numbers. The sequence goes from a fully unvectorized, looped structure, with no pre-allocation of the output vector, through to pure vectorized code. The intermediate steps are:\n\nLoop\nLoop with pre-allocated length of output\nsapply (like loops)\nsapply with pipe operator\nvectorized\nvectorized with no intermediate objects\nC++ vectorized\n\n\nlibrary(magrittr) # for pipe %&gt;%\nN = 1e5\n\nmb = microbenchmark::microbenchmark(times=100L,\n\n                                     \n# no pre-allocating of vector length, generating uniform random numbers once, then calling them within each loop\nloopWithNoPreallocate = {\n  set.seed(104)\n  a &lt;- numeric()\n  unifs = runif(N)\n    for (i in 1:N) {\n      a[i] = unifs[i]\n    } \n   a\n  } ,\n\n# pre-allocating vector length, generating uniform random numbers once, then calling them within each loop\nloopWithPreallocate = {\n    set.seed(104)\n    unifs &lt;- runif(N)\n    b &lt;- numeric(N) \n    for (i in 1:N) {\n      b[i] = unifs[i]\n    }\n    b\n  },\n \n# # sapply - generally faster than loops\nsapplyVector1 = {\n      set.seed(104)\n      b &lt;- runif(N) \n      sapply(b,function(x) x)\n      },\n\n# sapply with pipe operator: no intermediate objects are created\nsapplyWithPipe = {\n      set.seed(104)\n      b &lt;- (runif(N)) %&gt;%\n        sapply(.,function(x) x)\n      },\n\n# vectorized with intermediate object before return\nvectorizedWithCopy = {\n    set.seed(104)\n    unifs &lt;- runif(N)\n    unifs\n  },\n\n# no intermediate object before return\nvectorizedWithNoCopy = {\n  set.seed(104)\n  runif(N)\n  }\n\n)\n\nsummary(mb)[c(1,2,5,7)]\n\n                   expr     min   median      max\n1 loopWithNoPreallocate 21.9615 29.84165  89.6070\n2   loopWithPreallocate  7.6051  8.09575  16.7365\n3         sapplyVector1 55.2273 61.30605 111.2397\n4        sapplyWithPipe 52.7653 58.97110 115.2396\n5    vectorizedWithCopy  2.0667  2.21285   6.6799\n6  vectorizedWithNoCopy  2.0717  2.22310   6.0343\n\n# Test that all results return the same vector\nall.equalV(loopWithNoPreallocate, loopWithPreallocate, sapplyVector1, sapplyWithPipe, vectorizedWithCopy, vectorizedWithNoCopy)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nsumLoops &lt;- round(summary(mb)[[5]],0)\n\nThe fully vectorized function is 15x faster than the fully naive loop. Note also that making as few intermediate objects as possible is faster as well. Comparing vectorizedWithCopy and vectorizedWithNoCopy (where the only difference is making one copy of the object) shows virtually no change. This, I believe, is due to some improvements in after version 3.1 of R that reduces copying for vectors and matrices. Using pipes instead of intermediate objects also did not change the speed very much (slight change by 100%). These are simple tests, and for larger, or more complex objects, in general, it is likely that using pipes will be faster."

    "text": "In part 2 of this series on benchmarking R, we’ll explore sorting. This has been a topic on numerous blogs, discussions and posts around the internet, including here: r-blogger post. Similarly, julialang.org showed that sorting was particularly bad in R. We, again, felt that this was a case of poor R coding, or more accurately, missing the point of whether R was capable or not. Another example here compares R sorting with standard library of C++, called from R.\nIn all cases, we felt that one of the points of using R is that there are concise ways of doing things because the open source community has brought them to R. So lets take advantage of that! We will cover both real number sorting and integer sorting.\n\nSorting\nThis was in part inspired from a blog post by Wingfeet at https://www.r-bloggers.com/quicksort-speed-just-in-time-compiling-and-vectorizing/ which drew on benchmark tests here: https://julialang.org/ Essentially, that julia test was a benchmark to test the speed of Julia. It showed for the Quicksort, that R is 524x slower than C. Below is that version.

The slowest function is indeed the procedural qsort written in native R without any optimization. This was also the qsort that the Julia testers used. Our numbers match almost exactly those from the the table in julialang.org; however, here we also test the real world R usage that a normal R user would face (i.e., we can all use sort()). We show that R competes quite favourably and regularly outperforms standard library of C++ (and Julia!, though that is not tested here explicitly).\n\n\nTake home points:\n\nthe basic R sorting functions are fast. The sort(method=\"quick\") is about as fast as the standard C++ library sort (11% faster).\nusing data.table on integers is 32% faster than the C++ standard library sort.\n\nIn real world situations, where we want to use the easiest, shortest code to produce fast, accurate results, R certainly holds its own compared to the standard C++ library. But of course, there are many ways to do things in R. Some are much faster than others.\n\n\nConclusion\nUsing the sort(method=\"quick\") and data.table sorting, we were able to sort a vector of real numbers 412x faster than a naive procedural coding (qsort) and 687x faster on a vector of integers.

    "title": "Is R Fast Enough? - Part 1 - ‘The Mean’",
    "section": "",
    "text": "There have been many people, including ourselves, who have asked, “Is R fast enough for simulation modeling?”. In other words, can R handle everything we throw at it for simulation modeling? Low level functions, high level functions, GIS, data wrangling etc…\nAfter years of working with R as a data analysis and manipulation tool, we weren’t convinced that R was fast enough. We realize now that was mostly because of what we see and hear on the internet (e.g., see table in julialang.org). So, we started benchmarking R with a series of low and high level functions. This is part 1 of a multi-part series of posts about this benchmarking experiment with R in the coming weeks.\nThe objective of this experiment is to show some speed comparisons between R and other languages and software, including C++ and GIS software. Clearly this is NOT a comparison between R and, say, C++, because many of the functions in R are written in C++ and are wrapped in R. But, if simple R functions are fast, then we can focus our time on more complex things needed for simulation and science.\nSo, is R fast enough?\nAnswer: R is more than fast enough!\nWe will start with a fairly basic low level function, the “mean”…\n\nMean\nFor the mean, we show two different C++ versions. The R function, mean is somewhat slower (about half, but it does more things than just calculate the mean), but the colMeans(x) and calling the primitives directly with sum(x)/length(x) are as fast or faster than the fastest C++ function we can write.\nx &lt;- runif(1e6)\nx1 = matrix(x, ncol=1)\nm=list()\nbenchmark(m[[1]]&lt;-meanC1(x), m[[2]]&lt;-meanC2(x), m[[3]]&lt;-mean(x), \n                m[[4]]&lt;-mean.default(x), m[[5]]&lt;-sum(x)/length(x), \n                m[[6]]&lt;- .Internal(mean(x)), m[[7]]&lt;-colMeans(x1),\n                replications=2000L, columns=c(\"test\", \"elapsed\", \"relative\"), order=\"relative\")\n##                           test elapsed relative\n## 1          m[[1]] &lt;- meanC1(x)    1.86    1.000\n## 5   m[[5]] &lt;- sum(x)/length(x)    1.90    1.022\n## 7       m[[7]] &lt;- colMeans(x1)    1.94    1.043\n## 4    m[[4]] &lt;- mean.default(x)    3.81    2.048\n## 6 m[[6]] &lt;- .Internal(mean(x))    3.81    2.048\n## 3            m[[3]] &lt;- mean(x)    3.82    2.054\n## 2          m[[2]] &lt;- meanC2(x)   13.42    7.215\n# Test that all did the same thing\nall(sapply(1:6, function(y) all.equal(m[[y]],m[[y+1]])))\n## [1] TRUE\n\nConclusions\nYES! R is more than fast enough. But there is more to come… For the mean, the fastest way to calculate it for sizeable numeric vectors (1e6) is to use sum(x)/length(x), colMeans(x), or the efficient version of the C++ code meanC1. But, it is important to note that even the worst R version is better than an apparently minor coding decision in the second C++ version (meanC2 divides by N every time).\n\n\nNext time\nWe will redo the Fibonacci series, a common low level benchmarking test that shows R to be slow. But it turns out to be a case of bad coding…\n\n\nTake home message\nThe take home messages for the whole exercise are these:\n\nbuilt-in R functions (written in R or C++ or any other language) are often faster than ad hoc C++ functions, particularly if they are built with speed in mind (like colMeans).\nmost built-in R functions must to be used in a vectorized way to achieve these speeds, avoiding loops unless it is strictly necessary to keep the sequence (though see the data.table package)\nthere are often different ways to do the same thing in R; some are much faster than others (see following weeks posts). Use the Primitives where possible (names(methods:::.BasicFunsList))\n\n\n\n\nFunctions used\nThe C++ functions that were used are:\ncppFunction('double meanC1(NumericVector x) {\n  int n = x.size();\n  double total = 0;\n\n  for(int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) {\n    total += x[i];\n  }\n  return total / n;\n}')\n\n# inefficient because the /n is done within the loop\ncppFunction('double meanC2(NumericVector x) {\n  int n = x.size();\n  double y = 0;\n\n  for(int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) {\n    y += x[i] / n;\n  }\n  return y;\n}')\n\n\nSystem used:\nTests were done on an HP Z400, Xeon 3.33 GHz processor, running Windows 7 Enterprise, using:\n## R version 3.2.0 (2015-04-16)\n## Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit)\n## Running under: Windows 7 x64 (build 7601) Service Pack 1\n## \n## locale:\n## [1] LC_COLLATE=English_Canada.1252  LC_CTYPE=English_Canada.1252   \n## [3] LC_MONETARY=English_Canada.1252 LC_NUMERIC=C                   \n## [5] LC_TIME=English_Canada.1252    \n## \n## attached base packages:\n## [1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n## \n## other attached packages:\n## [1] Rcpp_0.11.5      rbenchmark_1.0.0\n## \n## loaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n## [1] formatR_1.1     tools_3.2.0     htmltools_0.2.6 yaml_2.1.13    \n## [5] rmarkdown_0.5.1 knitr_1.9       stringr_0.6.2   digest_0.6.8   \n## [9] evaluate_0.6"

All my research is applied to understanding forests, modelling them as well as possible given available data, to support science-based management and policy development. My research activities provide scientific support for Canada’s greenhouse gas (GHG) balance for forests under international reporting obligations, and contribute to the next generation of models for forest GHG estimates. I was a practicing forester and a biometrics consultant prior to becoming a researcher. I am therefore well positioned to provide viable solutions for both management and policy development. My recent focus has been on regional spatio-temporal modelling and the integration of remotely-sensed products into forest dynamics models. My masters from UBC biometrics (http://biometrics.forestry.ubc.ca/ ), and my PhD is from the Numerical Terradynamic Simulation group (NTSG - http://www.ntsg.umt.edu/), a NASA Earth Science Information Partner (http://www.esipfed.org/) at the University of Montana."

Because it is an iterative function, it can’t be vectorized, which is the usual way that we make R programs fast. Doing explicit loops in R is thought to be slow. So lets look…\nSimilarly, julialang.org showed that Fibonacci series was, again, particularly bad in R. We, again, felt that this was a case of poor R coding, or more accurately, missing the point of whether R was capable or not.\n\nFibonacci Series\nWe run 2 versions of C++, 2 versions of R that we build here, and 1 version within the numbers package from the open source R community.\n# Define two R functions\nfibR1 = function(n) {\n    fib &lt;- numeric(n)\n    fib[1:2] &lt;- c(1, 2)\n    for (k in 3:n) {\n        fib[k] &lt;- fib[k - 1] + fib[k - 2]\n    } \n    return(fib)\n}\nfibR2 = function(n) {\n     if (n &lt; 2) {\n         return(n)\n     } else {\n         return(fibR2(n-1) + fibR2(n-2))\n     }\n}\n\nN = 20L\nmbFib &lt;- microbenchmark(times=200L, \n                    a &lt;- fibonacci(N+1, TRUE)[N+1], \n                    b &lt;- fibCpp1(N+1), \n                    d &lt;- fibCpp2(N+1), \n                    e &lt;- fibR1(N)[N], \n                    f &lt;- fibR2(N+1))\nsummary(mbFib)[c(1,2,5,7)]\n##                                 expr       min     median        max\n## 1 a &lt;- fibonacci(N + 1, TRUE)[N + 1]    47.924    61.9015  16823.625\n## 2                b &lt;- fibCpp1(N + 1)    55.604    60.2115    110.899\n## 3                d &lt;- fibCpp2(N + 1)    55.604    61.4405    128.409\n## 4                   e &lt;- fibR1(N)[N]    35.329    44.8520    980.880\n## 5                  f &lt;- fibR2(N + 1) 85597.578 88614.4030 133390.309\nall.equalV(a,b,d, e, f)\n## [1] TRUE\nHere, one of the two native R implementations is 1599x faster by pre-allocating the output vector size. The fibonacci function in the package numbers was 2.36x slower than the faster R function because it has error checking. The native C++ version was 1.12x slower.\n\nTake home points:\n\nPre-allocate vectors. This is standard in other languages, yet it is not done in many basic tests of R code.\n\nR certainly held its own, again, compared to simple C++ functions precompiled using Rcpp package. In this case, we used native R with pre-allocation, and it was faster than the fastest C++ version. And of course, there was a very slow way to do things in R as well. The function within the package numbers was very fast and had nice checking within the function that is likely worth the overhead in many cases.\n\n\nConclusion\nYES! R is more than fast enough.\n\n\nNext time - Loops\nHow to make loops in R faster, for those times that you can’t make code vectorized.\n\n\n\nFunctions used\nThe C++ functions that were used are:\ncppFunction('int fibCpp2(const int x) {\n    if (x == 0 || x == 1) return(x);\n    return (fibCpp2(x - 1)) + fibCpp2(x - 2);\n}')\n\ncppFunction('int fibCpp1(int n) {\n    return n &lt; 2 ? n : fibCpp1(n-1) + fibCpp1(n-2);\n}')\n\nall.equalV = function(...) {\n  vals &lt;- list(...)\n  all(sapply(vals[-1], function(x) all.equal(vals[[1]], x)))\n}\n\n\nSystem used:\nTests were done on an HP Z400, Xeon 3.33 GHz processor, running Windows 7 Enterprise, using:\n## R version 3.2.0 (2015-04-16)\n## Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit)\n## Running under: Windows 7 x64 (build 7601) Service Pack 1\n## \n## locale:\n## [1] LC_COLLATE=English_Canada.1252  LC_CTYPE=English_Canada.1252   \n## [3] LC_MONETARY=English_Canada.1252 LC_NUMERIC=C                   \n## [5] LC_TIME=English_Canada.1252    \n## \n## attached base packages:\n## [1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n## \n## other attached packages:\n## [1] microbenchmark_1.4-2 numbers_0.5-6        Rcpp_0.11.5         \n## [4] rbenchmark_1.0.0    \n## \n## loaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n##  [1] codetools_0.2-11 digest_0.6.8     MASS_7.3-40      grid_3.2.0      \n##  [5] plyr_1.8.1       gtable_0.1.2     formatR_1.1      scales_0.2.4    \n##  [9] evaluate_0.6     ggplot2_1.0.1    reshape2_1.4.1   rmarkdown_0.5.1 \n## [13] proto_0.3-10     tools_3.2.0      stringr_0.6.2    munsell_0.4.2   \n## [17] yaml_2.1.13      colorspace_1.2-6 htmltools_0.2.6  knitr_1.9"

    "text": "Deployment\n\nPortable Applications\nFor light R application that only needs a local deployment, R portable and web browser portable such as Chrome applications can be used. It does not require as much performance on end user’s side and overall distribution will result in smaller files.\nRefer to this blog post by Lee Peng about Deploying Desktop Apps with R using portable apps\nRefer to this post to package your Shiny application as Windows application\n\n\nShiny Server\nIf you want to put your Shiny application on web, you can host it using Shiny Server. You would need to install, configure and manage the server yourself which could be complicated for some users.\nIf you want an ultimate experience of RShiny, there is also a paid service RShiny Server Pro, where you can host your application on Shiny server. There are a few useful functionalities that comes with the service such as\n\nUser Access Control\nMonitor application performance\nMonitor resource utilization\n\nHowever service is not cheap so if you have extra cash lying around, this would be a quick and easy way to host your application!\nRefer to this to find out more about Shiny Server\n\n\nShinyapps.io\nshinyapps.io is a multi-tenant platform as a service (PaaS) for hosting Shiny web applications. However it can also be expensive since the free edition can be limited depending on your needs.\nRefer to this where you can discover how to get started with shinyapps.io\nIf you cannot decide between shinyapps.io and Shiny Server Pro, refer to this FAQ\nSee below feature comparion chart between Shiny Server, Shiny Server Pro and shinyapps.io taken from this page\n\n\n\n\nComparison Chart\n\n\n\n\n\nDocker\nDocker containers wrap up a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything it needs to run:\n\nCode\nRuntime\nSystem tools\nSystem libraries\nAnything you can install on a server\n\nThis guarantees that it will always run the same, regardless of the environment it is running in. While this can be done with a virtual machine, Docker does not use a full OS, it shares the same host kernel meaning that it needs to run on Linux, but it is completely isolated environment. Since Docker containers are lighter than virtual machines, it makes testing much easier because you can always scrap that instance after!\nDocker can come in handy because you can create a Shiny server using few commands which simplifies deployment of a server.\nRefer to this blog post to get your Shiny app ‘dockerized’.\n\n\nOpenCPU HTTP API for R\nOpenCPU is an open source solution for embedded R computing. The software can be freely used, modified and redistributed for both for open source and proprietary projects in academia, industry or elsewhere. All parts of OpenCPU are released under the Apache2 license. The free OpenCPU framework provides a reliable and interoperable HTTP API for R data analysis. You can either call the public servers or download and install OpenCPU’s code on your own servers.\nRefer to this blog post by Jen Underwood on how you can integrate R\n\n\nRook\nRook is a lightweight web server interface for R developed by Jeffrey Horner that does not need any configuration file as Rook is a R package which works out of the box with R HTTP server. The idea behind this is to separate application development from server implementation. Thus, when a web server supports a web server interface, an application written to its specifications is guaranteed to run on that server. So then you would need to do some learning on HTTP to develop Rook applications.\nRefer to this blog post by Ben Ogorek on a tutorial on building simple web application using Rook\nRefer to this CRAN for package description of Rook"

Kitematic is a GUI where users can upload and download Docker images to run it in their Docker containers. This makes distributing very simple and easy as Docker Hub can work like App Store! Below is a snapshot of Kitematic.\n\n\n\n\nSnapshot of Kitematic\n\n\n\nRefer to this blog post to learn how you can share your Shiny application with Docker and Kitematic\n\n\nGitHub\nYou can share your code in a repository where other users can contribute by suggestions, corrections and additions. When another user clones your repository, the directory structure is kept so that all data is preserved as where they belong.\n\n\nR Package\nIf you are an awesome R programmer, creating a R package is an useful way to distribute and share within R community. R packages are stored in Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) repository where there is extra level of testing to enforce certain structure so users can ensure quality packages.\nRefer to this blog post on how you can get started on creating a R package by David Smith"

Can we go from 7 back to 37?\nMaybe… it depends on a bunch of things. We certainly could do it probabilistically… level 3 becomes 5, 12, 15, and 23 with probabilies 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4… or we could do a Bayesian version, where the probability is affected by the prior level of that pixel in the 37 level FC classification (assuming we went from 37 to 7 and now are going back to 37). These translations could be data driven, or expert driven or whatever.

    "text": "What is Rmarkdown?\nThe folks behind the RStudio IDE have completely changed how a majority of R users work with and program in R. Not only have they provided an exceptional IDE for working with and debugging R code, Rstudio also includes a number of important features that facilitate project management, package management, interactive graphics, and dynamic document generation.\nThis is where Rmarkdown come in.\nRmarkdown documents allow you to combine your “data, code, and narrative” in a single file, similar to project notebooks in MatLab, Mathematica, and others. This facilitates the integration of project development, data analyses, and report writing. Each of the components of your project can be tied together and, crucially, easily rerun when data are updated or changes need to be made to other steps in the research workflow.\nRmarkdown files follow the markdown mark up language, which is designed to be both human and machine readable. Although you edit .Rmd files in text form, the files are converted to their ‘final’ format (.pdf, .html, etc.) using the knitr package and pandoc. It is very easy to incorporate text, images, equations, code, etc. into .Rmd files which can then be rendered in a wide variety of file formats.\nImportantly, because Rmarkdown files (.Rmd) are text files, they are easily incorporated into a git or other version control system. This further enhances the utility of Rmarkdown for scientific projects because with version control, one can see the evolution of a project from start to finish."

    "title": "Rmarkdown in a scientific workflow",
    "section": "Using Rmarkdown throughout the scientific workflow",
    "text": "Using Rmarkdown throughout the scientific workflow\n\nInitial project conception\nMost (all?) researchers maintain a project notebook of some type to track the development of their projects. These notebooks are crucial for accountability and tracking project history and progress, and are invaluable references during the final stages of a project (i.e., writing manuscripts). Text, code, equations, and data can all be maintained in an .Rmd file. Handwritten project sketches and notes can also be digitized for inclusion.\n\n\nData analyses\nThis is where most discussion about using Rmarkdown occurs. R code is run and the output of analyses can be directly inserted into the text narrative, as inline results, separate code blocks, tables, and figures. This makes rerunning things a breeze, and can be used to generate dynamic reports.\nUsing version control, you don’t have to worry about maintaining old code and commenting it out as the project matures – just delete it (it’s still available in the version control history). This means you can always keep your .Rmd files up to date and ready to share with collaborators (or reviewers).\nOne important additional note: knitr supports caching of Rmarkdown code blocks, which means you don’t need to rerun all analyses when updating a report.\n\n\nCollaboration\nI use a collaborative workflow using R, Rmarkdown, and GitHub. However, most of my colleagues do not. This has been the most difficult challenge to overcome. How do I convince people to 1) adopt an open and reproducible workflow (e.g., use Rmarkdown instead of MS Word), and 2) use version control (i.e., git)?\nIn many cases, after spending some time with my colleagues to highlight the advantages and teach them how to use the tools, they are happily converted. However, even with most collaborators adopting this workflow, if even a single one doesn’t it can add additional work to my plate.\nCurrently, I’ll push changes to the project’s GitHub repository, usually tagging my collaborators in the relevant commit messages for them to take a look. I’ll also send an email (with the current version attached) and solicit feedback via GitHub.\nFor my collaborators using GitHub regularly, it’s easy – they make changes, we merge, and rebuild the documents as needed. But I still get emails back with a modified / annotated version of the file I sent out, which means I need to be the one to manually make changes and push them to GitHub. Getting (late) feedback on an old version of a draft sent out by email when the current GitHub version has seen substantial changes is even more frustrating to deal with. Annoying, but not the end of the world.\nI’m not discouraged! The time spend incorporating changes is mostly about copy-paste into the current version – no different than my old workflow using MS Word. I think the time saved in other parts of the workflow make up for the additional time spent here.\nI’m looking forward to more of my colleagues using .Rmd files, though I note that currently there is no good way of annotating documents. One method is to add text directly, which appears in the final rendered document. Another is to use HTML-style comments (&lt;!-- comments go here --&gt;) in the .Rmd file which will not appear in the final rendered document. Edit: Using GitHub directly to comment on specific lines within a commit can also work reasonably well, but you don’t get all annotations from multiple versions in a single location.\n\n\nPublication\nThis one is improving everyday. Basic article publication tools are already included with Rstudio and RMarkdown (including citations); however, for more advanced formatting there are other packages like rticles (which I’m using for my current manuscripts) and bookdown for book formatting. As a fallback, you can adopt HTML and LaTeX markup in your .Rmd files, and use additional CSS or LaTeX templates as needed.\nOwing to the long history of TeX in scientific publications, most journals not only accept .tex file submissions but also provide the necessary templates (some of these are included with the rticles package), and citation style (.csl) files can be downloaded from https://www.zotero.org/styles.\n\n\nCommunication\n\nEmail\nOne of the major selling points of markdown is that it’s a human-readable markup language (contrast against LaTeX or HTML). In principle, you can use markdown formatting for emails but most email programs will render them as text unless your recipient has a markdown converter (there are a few for e.g., Gmail).\n\n\nBlogs\nMost blogging platforms support markdown (by default or with additional plugins). This blog renders the markdown files (generated from .Rmd files) we upload into HTML format with all the appropriate syntax highlighting, etc. It’s a phenomenal way to create content locally and render the results reliably on a blog."

Copying and pasting code from old projects actually works the first time – because I’m tracking these old projects using ‘living documentation’ that includes everything needed to run the code again: data, scripts, and associated explanations.\nIt’s worth the effort, and I encourage you to start using Rmarkdown."

    "text": "A previous post discussed how to manage large SpaDES projects, and suggested the following project directory structure:\nmyProject/            # a version controlled git repo\n  |_  .git/\n  |_  cache/            # should be .gitignore'd\n  |_  inputs/           # should be .gitignore'd (selectively)\n  |_  manuscripts/\n  |_  modules/\n    |_  module1/      # can be a git submodule\n    |_  module2/      # can be a git submodule\n    |_  module3/      # can be a git submodule\n    |_  module4/      # can be a git submodule\n    |_  module5/      # can be a git submodule\n  |_  outputs/          # should be .gitignore'd\n  ...\nThe layout of a project directory is somewhat flexible, but this approach works especially well if you’re a module developer using git submodules for each of your module subdirectories. And each module really should be its own git repository:\n\npeople don’t need to pull everything in just to work on a single module;\nmakes it possible to use git submodules for [Rstudio] projects;\neasy to setup additional SpaDES module repositoriess.\n\nHowever, note that you cannot nest a git repository inside another git repository. So if you are using git for your project directory, you cannot use SpaDES modules as repos inside that project directory (this is what git submodules are for). If git submodules aren’t your thing, then you will need to keep your project repo separate from your module repo!\nmodules/                # use this for your simulation modulePath\n  |_  module1/\n  |_  module2/\n  |_  module3/\n  |_  module4/\n  |_  module5/\n\nmyProject/\n  |_  cache/            # use this for your simulation cachePath\n  |_  inputs/           # use this for your simulation inputPath\n  |_  manuscripts/\n  |_  outputs/          # use this for your simulation outputPath\n  ...\nAlternatively, your myProject/ directory could be a subdirectory of modules/.\nmodules/                # use this for your simulation modulePath\n  |_  module1/\n  |_  module2/\n  |_  module3/\n  |_  module4/\n  |_  module5/\n  |_  myProject/\n    |_  cache/          # use this for your simulation cachePath\n    |_  inputs/         # use this for your simulation inputPath\n    |_  manuscripts/\n    |_  outputs/        # use this for your simulation outputPath\n  ...\nThese allow you to have each module and project be a git repository, and if you’re worried about storage space it ensures you only keep one copy of a module no matter how many projects it’s used with. However, the drawback is that it’s inconsistent with the way Rstudio projects work, because not all project-related files are in the same directory. This means you need to take extra care to ensure that you set your module path using a relative file path (e.g., ../modules), and you’ll need to take even more care to update this path if you move the modules/ directory or are sharing your project code (because your collaborator may store their modules in a different location).\nIn the end, which approach you use will depend on your level of git-savviness (and that of your collaborators), and how comfortable you are using git submodules."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Northwestern Canada is one of the most rapidly warming regions on Earth. The scale and rapidity of recently observed warming-induced changes indicate that this region is particularly sensitive to climate warming. Unprecedented changes in snow cover and rates of permafrost thaw are transforming ecosystems (e.g., conversion of forests to wetlands; lakes to thaw lake basins; tundra to shrub vegetation), and changing the distribution and routing of water over the landscape, which confounds predictions of ecohydrological responses to warming and changes in precipitation. Altered water flows and sediment regimes have affected the structure and function of streams, rivers, and lakes, including key waterways used for hydropower, water supply, and transportation. These changes directly affect the health, wellbeing, safety and livelihoods of northern communities. As a consequence, government decision makers, Indigenous communities, and co-management boards urgently require science-based predictive tools and user-driven mitigation and adaptation strategies to ensure that “the waters of the Northwest Territories will remain clean, abundant and productive for all time”, as envisioned in the NWT Water Stewardship Strategy.\nWe are seeking a quantitative ecologist/modeler to participate in a large, collaborative project on northern ecosystem dynamics under changing climate. In partnership with academics and several government agencies, the goal of this multi-year research program is to forecast the dynamics of below- and aboveground processes under the anticipated changes coming with climate, natural disturbance, and positive and negative feedbacks. This specific project involves developing forecasting models that couple simulation and statistical models of thermokarst vulnerability, landcover change, above- and below-ground carbon dynamics, and fire dynamics under changing climate. The models will become part of a rich network of models that are compatible with the open R/SpaDES framework (spades.predictiveecology.org). This will enable us to answer multi-faceted questions related to ecosystem change and land management by Indigenous groups, territorial and federal governments, as well as evaluation of other connected issues such as protected areas and species at risk. The new contributions made here will contribute to a general and flexible suite of independent forecasting models that will be configured to meet the emerging needs of our research team, the scientific community and land management pressures in the North. The successful candidate will work with a team of landscape scientists, northern scientists, R programmers and quantitative ecologists to forecast the direct and indirect consequences of climate change on thermokarst, above- and below-ground carbon, natural disturbances, and vegetation dynamics.\nQualifications:\n\nPh.D. in ecology, natural resource sciences, applied mathematics, computer science, statistics, or a related field;\nEvidence of publishing in peer reviewed literature;\nExperience with modeling of vegetation, soils, hydrology, or permafrost;\nHigh-level programming skills (e.g., R or Python);\nExperience with statistical modelling;\nExperience with spatial simulation modelling an asset;\nExperience with Geographic Information Systems and remotely sensed data an asset;\nAble to confidently interact with people of varying backgrounds;\nExperience with climate change projections an asset.\n\nThe direct supervisor will be Eliot McIntire (Pacific Forestry Centre, expertise in applied ecology, conservation and forecasting ecosystems and species) with Jenn Baltzer and Steve Cumming as remote co-supervisors. Additional collaborators on this Northern Water Futures and GNWT Cumulative Impacts Monitoring Project-funded project will include Merritt Turetsky and Kathe Todd-Brown and other post-doctoral fellows and graduate students. The successful candidate will also become part of the Predictive Ecology lab, providing and benefitting from technical support within the group.\nLocation of tenure: The postdoctoral fellow will be administered as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC. The position will be physically located in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, at the Pacific Forestry Centre. There will be opportunities for one or more extended visits to the other labs in the larger project (Baltzer Lab at Wilfrid Laurier University, Waterloo, Ontario and/or Cumming Lab at Laval University, Quebec City) to work with collaborators. Field work is not a principle objective of this position, however, there will be opportunities if desired. Given the current reality of COVID-19, alternative physical locations can be discussed.\nStart date, duration, & compensation: The 2-year position will ideally start in Sept 2020 or as soon after that as possible. The annual salary is $53,000 plus benefits. There will be $5000 for travel, publications, and conferences per year.\nTo Apply: Please provide a letter of interest, your CV, and an example of your writing skills in the form of a peer-reviewed manuscript. Your letter should indicate how you meet each of the criteria, and state when you are able to start and when you can relocate to British Columbia.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Northern ecosystems in Canada are changing at a rate twice as fast as other areas of the globe due to climate change. Climate change can result in direct effects on wildlife (higher mortality, lower reproduction) but also indirect effects on their habitat through changes in vegetation (e.g. shifts in tree species composition within forests) and natural disturbances like wildfire (e.g. increase in the frequency and size of fires). In addition to climate change, northern ecosystems are affected by human disturbance primarily associated with resource development that includes: forestry, conventional oil and gas development and extraction, mineral mining, wind power, linear features and road development. Boreal caribou are a species of cultural, economic, and ecological importance in northern regions of Canada. Numerous sources have identified these anthropogenic disturbances as the most important contributor to declines of boreal caribou; yet, forecasting these disturbances, and their interactions with vegetation and natural disturbances under climate change remains a challenge.\nWe are seeking a quantitative scientist/modeller to develop new models that can forecast the impacts of resource development on boreal caribou resource selection and population demographics in Northwest Territories (NT), Canada. The goals of this multi-year postdoctoral fellowship are to: (1) compile resource development potential mapping within the boreal region of Northwest Territories, Canada (NT); (2) integrate resource development potential mapping with forecasts of vegetation, wildfire, climate, and caribou developed within the boreal regions within NT; and (3) forecast through time (2021-2100) the regional cumulative effects of resource development, vegetation, wildfire, and climate on habitat supply and boreal caribou population demographics by examining resource development scenarios. The fellowship is funded by the Cumulative Impact Monitoring Program of the Government of NT and supported by Environment and Climate Change Canada and Natural Resources Canada. The position will become part of the ongoing Western Boreal Initiative, a large, collaborative project aiming to help with the implementation of the Pan-Canadian Approach to Species-at-Risk Conservation and is a partnership with academics, government agencies, and First Nations. This project will take advantage of an open modeling framework – SpaDES, developed within the R language – to integrate the novel components created here with existing models (vegetation dynamics, wildfire, caribou resource selection and population growth). Results from this work will help inform current and future cumulative effects on boreal caribou habitat supply and population demography and support caribou range planning and decision making in the NT. The successful candidate will work with a network of landscape scientists, northern scientists, caribou biologists, R programmers, and quantitative ecologists.\n\nQualifications:\n\nPh.D. in ecology, natural resource sciences, geography, applied mathematics, computer science, statistics, or a related field;\nEvidence of publishing in peer reviewed literature;\nExperience with modelling of vegetation, soils, hydrology, permafrost, wildfire, or wildlife species;\nHigh-level programming skills (e.g., R or Python);\nExperience with statistical modelling an asset;\nExperience with spatial simulation modelling an asset;\nExperience with Geographic Information Systems and remotely sensed data an asset;\nExperience with climate change projections an asset;\nAble to interact collaboratively with people of varying backgrounds.\n\nThe postdoctoral fellowship will work with Drs. Eliot McIntire (Pacific Forestry Centre, expertise in applied ecology, conservation and forecasting ecosystems and species & UBC), James Hodson (Gov. NT) and C. Lisa Mahon (Environment and Climate Change Canada, U Alberta). Additional collaborators on this project will include Dr. Samuel Hache and Bruce Laurich (Environment and Climate Change Canada), and Drs. Alex Chubaty (FOR-CAST) and Tati Micheletti (UBC) and other post-doctoral fellows and graduate students. The successful candidate will also become part of the Predictive Ecology lab, providing and benefitting from technical support within the group.\n\n\nLocation of tenure\nThe postdoctoral fellow will be administered at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC or through the Canadian Federal Government Postdoctoral programme. The position will be located in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, at the Pacific Forestry Centre. However, given the current reality of COVID-19, alternative physical locations can be discussed. There may be opportunities for visits to NT to work with collaborators and engage partners although travel with depend on current COVID-19 public health guidance. Field work is not anticipated.\n\n\nStart date, duration, & compensation\nThe 3-year position will begin as soon as the candidate is available, with an ideal start in September 2021. The annual salary is $53,000 plus benefits. There will be $5000 for travel, publications, and conferences per year. As travel restrictions are still uncertain due to COVID-19, the precise details of this will be adjusted according to provincial and federal recommendations.\n\n\nTo Apply\nPlease provide a letter of interest, your CV, and an example of your writing skills in the form of a peer-reviewed manuscript.

    "title": "PhD position in Ecological Modelling: drought impacts on British Columbia’s forests",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The interior forests of British Columbia (BC) are at particular risk from changes in drought regimes accompanying climate changes. Several tree species in interior BC may already be close to their drought tolerance limits, and further increases in drought intensity and severity could directly and indirectly (via pests, disease and fire) impact tree recruitment, growth and background mortality. This will likely lead to important changes in forest composition and structure, as well as ecosystem services such as carbon retention and timber supply. Despite mounting evidence of drought effects on interior BC forests, the degree to which they will directly and indirectly influence forests and their ecosystem services is unknown across large landscape scales, given the combined stochasticity of drought and non-drought disturbances (e.g. fire) and climate uncertainty.\nWe are looking for a highly motivated enthusiastic and independent person to embark on a 4-year ecological modelling PhD focused on forecasting drought regimes and their impacts on forest dynamics and forest ecosystem services in BC. In particular, the project is aimed at 1) developing a drought effects module for the forest landscape model LandR (Barros et al. 2023 Methods Ecol. Evol.; see also Micheletti et al. 2021 Front. Ecol. Evol.); 2) parameterising direct drought effects on tree species growth and mortality from available empirical data; and 3) simulating forest dynamics under the effects of drought, fire and climate warming and how they translate into changes in ecosystem services.\nCandidates for this position should have:\n\nAn MSc degree in ecology, forestry, environmental sciences or a related field with a strong interest in applied statistics and ecological mechanistic modelling, or an MSc degree in statistics, mathematics, data sciences, or physics with a strong interest in ecological applications\nSolid background knowledge of statistical methods applied to ecological questions\nExperience in programming in R, or a similar programming language (e.g. Python)\nExperience and/or background knowledge of ecological modelling using statistical and mechanistic approaches\nOral and written fluency in English\nAbility to contribute to a positive environment in an inclusive and diverse team\n\nThe position will be based at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver campus, with periods spent at the Ministry of Forests in Victoria.\nIn our team, we strive to create a positive and safe work environment. We believe that diverse backgrounds are essential for academic excellence. We therefore encourage applications from members of underrepresented groups.\nTo apply, please e-mail a one page statement describing your motivation to carry out a PhD project on this topic, a current curriculum vitae, copies of your academic transcripts and contact information for two academic references, using “Application: Ecological Modelling PhD, UBC” as the e-mail subject. Send your e-mail to:\nignacio[dot]barbeito[at]ubc[dot]ca\nceres[dot]barros[at]gov[dot]bc[dot]ca\nThe deadline for applications is September 30th 2023. Start date is flexible and expected to be by no later than May 1st 2024.\nFeel free to send inquiries about this position.\nWhile we thank all candidates for applying, only short-listed candidates will be contacted for interviews."

    "section": "",
    "text": "We have been asked multiple times how we are “dealing with the transition from raster to terra”. The answer is, somewhat painfully and more slowly than we had hoped for.\nMuch of what we do involves manipulating spatial objects (raster or vector data) be it for data extraction (e.g., extracting data for statistical modelling), results production (e.g., outputting results spatially) or visualisation (e.g., making maps) and our packages and SpaDES modules were deeply intertwined with the raster and sp packages.\nWe have started the transition more than a year ago and still haven’t finished. Part of the reason why this takes so long is because we are attempting to keep backwards compatibility. Which take us to the purpose of this post.\nOur advice to others in the same transition journey as us:\n\nTry to keep backwards compatibility. Many terra functions allow passing Raster* class objects. Where they don’t, make your own function wrappers to deal with this. We have a few in the reproducible and LandR (on GitHub) packages (see table bellow)\nTest.
